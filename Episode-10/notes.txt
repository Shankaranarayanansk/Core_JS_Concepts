hoisting means which moves the variable declaration and 
function moves to top of the code excution

When we use the hoisting concept for var it shows undefined
only declaration not initialization

Reason y let not works on hoisting 
 -temporal Dead Zone(let and const comes under it)
 -let and const through err becoz it need to initilize declare is not enough
 -only possible for named functions (for var typeErr and let says reference err)
